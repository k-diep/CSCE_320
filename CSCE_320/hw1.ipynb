    "*Submission instructions (Canvas):* To submit your homework, rename this notebook as `UIN_hw1.ipynb`. For example, if your UIN is `123456789`, then your homework submission would be something like `123456789_hw1.ipynb`. Submit this notebook via Canvas (looking for homework 1 under the assignment section. Your notebook should be completely self-contained, with the results visible in the notebook. We should not have to run any code from the command line, nor should we have to run your code within the notebook (though we reserve the right to do so). So please run all the cells for us, and then submit. \n",

Your solution should be written by you without the direct aid or help of anyone else. However, we believe that collaboration and team work are important for facilitating learning, so we encourage you to discuss problems and general problem approaches (but not actual solutions) with your classmates. If you do have a chat with another student about a homework problem, you must inform us by writing a note on your homework submission (e.g., Bob pointed me to the relevant section for problem 3). The basic rule is that no student should explicitly share a solution with another student (and thereby circumvent the basic learning process), but it is okay to share general approaches, directions, and so on. If you feel like you have an issue that needs clarification, feel free to contact either me or the TA.*"
